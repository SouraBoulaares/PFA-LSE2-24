## 🛠️ Project Setup Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup 🗂️
1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don't already have one) at [https://github.com](https://github.com).
2. One team member should **create a new repository**:
   - Go to **GitHub** → **Repositories** → **New**.
   - Name the repository (e.g., `java-project-teamX`).
   - Add a description (e.g., "A Java-based software engineering project").
   - Select **Public** or **Private**.
   - Add a **README.md** (this file).
3. **Invite team members** as collaborators:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Collaborators**.
   - Add team members by GitHub usernames.

### 2. Clone the Repository ⬇️
Each team member should:
1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

## ⚙️ Project Development Steps

### 1. Define Functional and Non-Functional Requirements 📝
- **Functional Requirements (FR)**: List the core features the software must perform (e.g., user registration, data validation).
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**: Define the system's quality attributes, like performance, security, scalability.

### 2. Select a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 🔄
Your team should select an appropriate **SDLC** for managing the project's development. Here are some examples:

- **Waterfall**: A linear, sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
- **Agile (Scrum, Kanban)**: An iterative approach where the project is developed incrementally.
- **Spiral**: Focuses on risk management and is ideal for large, complex projects.
- **V-Model**: An extension of the Waterfall model that emphasizes testing at each phase.

After reviewing, choose the best model for your project and document your choice in this `README.md`.

### 3. Define Your Process (If Agile) ⚡
If you choose **Agile**, such as **Scrum** or **Kanban**, follow these steps:

#### Scrum Example
1. **Roles**:
   - **Product Owner**: Defines the vision and backlog.
   - **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the process.
   - **Team Members**: Develop the product.
2. **Sprint Planning**: Break the project into **Sprints** (1-2 week cycles) with goals.
3. **Daily Standups**: Short meetings to discuss progress and blockers.
4. **Sprint Review & Retrospective**: After each Sprint, review the work and reflect on how to improve.
